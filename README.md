## Project Overview
Global unicorn companies refer to privately-held startup companies valued at over $1 billion. These companies are often characterized by rapid growth, disruptive innovation, and the potential to transform industries. The term "unicorn" was coined by venture capitalist Aileen Lee in 2013 to describe the rarity of such companies, as they were once considered mythical creatures in the business world due to their scarcity.

The evolution of global unicorn companies has been remarkable, with their rise closely tied to advancements in technology and changes in consumer behavior. Over the past few decades, especially with the advent of the internet and digital technologies, the number of unicorn companies has grown significantly, spanning various sectors such as e-commerce, fintech, healthcare, transportation, and beyond.

Some notable examples of global unicorn companies include:

**Uber:** Founded in 2009, Uber revolutionized the transportation industry by introducing a peer-to-peer ridesharing platform accessible via a mobile app. 

**Airbnb:** Launched in 2008, Airbnb disrupted the hospitality industry by enabling individuals to rent out their homes or spare rooms to travelers.

**Stripe:** Founded in 2010, Stripe provides online payment processing solutions for businesses, allowing them to accept payments over the internet. 

**SpaceX:** Founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, SpaceX is on a mission to revolutionize space exploration and make humanity a multi-planetary species. 

**ByteDance:** ByteDance, founded in 2012, is a Chinese technology company known for its flagship product, TikTok, a short-form video-sharing app. 

**Palantir Technologies:** Founded in 2003, Palantir Technologies specializes in big data analytics and software solutions for government agencies, financial institutions, and other organizations. 

These are just a few examples of the many global unicorn companies that have emerged in recent years, each making significant contributions to their respective industries and reshaping the way we live, work, and interact in the modern world.

Moving forward to the main aim of this project, we will be analyzing the emergence, evolvement and funding trends of Global Unicorn Companies.

It is made up of CSV files for Global Unicorn Companies from the founding of the first Unicorn in 1919 to the year 2021. The Data_Dictionary.csv file gives an explanation of the fields in the main dataset Unicorn_Companies.csv, while the main dataset comes with the columns: Company, Valuation, Date Joined, Industry, City, Country, Continent, Year Founded, Funding, and Select Investors.
